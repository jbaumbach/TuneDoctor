The Problem
-----------
For those of us with massive iTunes music libraries located on external storage like a NAS, using iTunes can be a headache.  When manipulating your songs, if the NAS is in powersaving mode then iTunes will think your songs are missing!  It then puts a nice little explamation point next to the song title and it won't sync with your phone anymore.

The Solution
------------
You can fix it manually yourself by playing each song, one by one.  That works, but it takes forever!  This program takes the manual part out of it.  Just run iTunes, select the songs or albums with exclamation points to fix, run this program, and click the "Remove!" button.
